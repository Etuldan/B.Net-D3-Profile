# Battle.net Diablo3 Profile page

This script will display all your characters in the Battle.Net Diablo3 Profile Page.  
Actually, the non-modified page show only 10 characters, while you can have more than 10 In Game. The script will show all of them. It will also reduce the font-size of the nickames, as some of them which are 'long' could be truncated.


You will need a GreaseMonkey extension for your browser :  
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
- Chrome : Builtin, but you have to download the d3-profile.user.js file, then drag&drop it into the Extension page of Chrome
