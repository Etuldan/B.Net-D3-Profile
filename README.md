# Battle.net Diablo3 Profile page

This script will display all your characters in the Battle.Net Diablo3 Profile Page.  
Actually, the non-modified page show only 10 characters, while you can have more than 10 In Game. The script will show all of them.  
It will also reduce the font-size of the nickames, as some of them which are 'long' could be truncated.
